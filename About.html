      <h1>About Manual</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, and welcome to Manual Highschool's unofficial website, created by a Freshman, Jordan Briggs! <br />
        Firstly, we'd like to thank the Senior teachers at Manual who agreed to do this with us! The ones Jordan<br />
        interviewed are Mr. Dreamer, and Ms. Avina. Now, let's not waste anymore of your time and get to the point.
      </p>

      <h3>Ms. Avina</h3>
      <p>Question: What are the traditions at Manual you look forward to?</p>
      <p>
        Answer<br />The traditions I look forward to every year is graduation, because it never feels professional, <br />
        and it always feels so fun.
      </p>
      <h3>Jordan's Opinion</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone at Manual should hear that Ms. Avina looks forward to Graduation, because that allows their <br />
        parents to stay at Manual until Graduation happens, whilst having the same friends they had in their <br />
        Freshman year at Manual.
      </p>
      <h3>Mr. Dreamer</h3>
      <p>Question: What are the traditions at Manual you look forward to?</p>
      <p>Answer<br />One thing I look forward to is Graduation, as well as the Homecoming Football Game. I look forward to <br />
      these every year because the Homecoming Football Game is one of the best things to happen at Manual! <br />
      With all the rage and excitment, it just feels so exiting! Graduation on the other side... Feels the same! <br />
      You see, Graduation isn't like most, it's not professional nor formal, and is always such a fun experience! <br />
      The thing I enjoy about Graduation is how it's more like a party, because well, that's what Graduation should be.</p>
      <h3>Jordan's Opinion</h3>
      <p>
        As a member to Manual, this is important to me and others because it makes us look forward to Graduation, <br />
        because usually we want the best experience we can get. I also believe this is important, as it gives me a <br />
        higher chance to remain in Highschool, specifically Manual, and graduate. This is also important for others, <br />
        as it highly decreases the chances of them dropping out, because they're probably gonna want the best job they can get.
