      <h3>Importance and Culture of Manual</h3>
      <p>
        One <bold>very</bold> important feature at Manual is the "M" in the Lobby. it's quite disrespectful to step<br />
        on the "M" at Manual, because it's Manual's original logo, and it represents Manual's community as a whole.<br />

      </p>
      <p>Manual Highschool also has their own Military training, for those who wish to be in the U.S. Military. <br />Hell, they even have trophies, as well as models of their planes and/or jets!
      </p>

      <p>Manual was originally created/built around the early 1800's, meaning they have pictures of some <bold>old</bold><br />
      vehicles, such as the one shown below.</p>

      <p>A very unfortunate event, I must say. May 16, 1953, is the date the original Manual Highschool building <br />
      burnt down.</p>

      <p>Manual Highschool even has their own Liscense Plate for Colorado, how rare is that? A Liscense Plate for a school!</p>
